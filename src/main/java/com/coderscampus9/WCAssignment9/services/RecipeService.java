//	For this assignment, you’ll need to ingest a recipe.txt file and store this information in a Java Collection of your choice.
//	You will need to use the Apache Commons CSV project to parse the text file. 
//	The final video in this week’s lessons shows you how to import the Apache Commons CSV project.
//	You may also need to create a Configuration class, but that will depend on how you structure your code.
